# Get
Now that we can insert our users and their records into our hashmap, we need a way to retrieve that information when requested!

## Assignment
Complete the get method. It takes a key (a string) and returns the value stored at that location (not the whole key/value tuple).

Use the key_to_index method to find the correct index to look up in the self.hashmap datastore, and if a value doesn't exist at that index, raise the following Exception to indicate no key was found.
```
raise Exception("sorry, key not found")
```
*Due to our simple implementation, some of the keys that are inserted into the hashmap will have colliding values, which may lead to strange results - that's okay!*
